# Assignment 8: APIs and Regression
In this assignment you will use a "hidden" API in the Virginia elections site to download  county-level presidential election results and then analyze the results. Please commit python scripts `a1.py, a2.py, b1.py, b2.py, b3.py, b4.py, ANSWERS>txt` and the images specified below.

# Part A: API
Your task is to download all of the CSVs for all of the presidential general elections in Virginia from their [Elections Database website](http://historical.elections.virginia.gov/) and save them as `data/1924.csv,...,data/2016.csv`.

First, visit the website in your browser and use the interface to find a list of all presidential general elections. The URL will look like this:

```
http://historical.elections.virginia.gov/elections/search/year_from:1924/year_to:2016/office_id:1
```

Click on one of them, say 2016, and then click "See Details for this Election" and you'll be taken to this URL:

```
http://historical.elections.virginia.gov/elections/view/80871/
```

Click "Download this Election" on the left bar and then "Municipality Results" and you'll get a CSV at this URL:

```
http://historical.elections.virginia.gov/elections/download/80871/precincts_include:0/
```

Note that `80871` is the identifier for that the website is using for this election.

1. Create a CSV file called `election_ids.csv` with two columns: `year` and `election_id` where `election_id` is the id used by the website for the presidential election in the corresponding year. (4 points)

    Hint: The result should start like this:
    
    ```
    election_id,year
    80871,2016
    ....
    ```
    
    The HTML source for the 2016 election row looks like this:

    ```html
     <tr id="election-id-80871" class="election_item general_party">

               <td class="year first" style="padding: 7px 4px;">2016</td>
               <td class="" style="padding: 7px 4px;">President</td>
               <td class="" style="padding: 7px 4px;">Statewide</td>
               <td class="party_border_top">General Election</td>
     ...
    ```
    
    So you can find the election rows by looking for `tr` tags with a class of `election_item` (not that spaces in the class string denote multiple classes). You can find their ids by grabbing the `id` attribute and extracting the number from the end. You can find the year of the election in the text of the next `td` tag.

2. Get and save the CSV for each year to files `data/1924.csv,...,data/2016.csv`. (4 points)

    Hint: To iterate over the rows in a DataFrame you can use the following pattern:
    
    ```python
    for i, row in df.iterrows():
        # now row is a Series with index ['election_id', 'year']
    ```
    
    Note that when reading `election_ids.csv`, pandas will automatically use numeric types for `election_id` and `year`. To use them in a filename you'll need to convert them to strings, e.g. `open('data/' + str(year) + '.csv', 'w')`.

# Part B: Analyze

1. Create a new CSV called `republican_shares.csv` with three columns: Year, County/City, and `R_SHARE` where the last column is the proportion of all votes cast for the Republican candidate. Note that the `County/City` column in the downloaded CSVs is not quite accurate because there are congressional district subdivisions (e.g. `Chesterfield County (CD 4)`). So you'll have to aggregate the data up to the true `County/City` level. (8 points)

    Hints:

    - For each year's DataFrame, find the Republican candidate's column.
    - [Drop](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/generated/pandas.DataFrame.drop.html) the first row; subset to just the Republican's and Total Votes Cast columns, convert those to numbers (they are currently strings with commas in them)
    - Remove the congressional districts in the `County/City` column, e.g. replace `Chesterfield County (CD 4)` to just `Chesterfield County`.
    - Find the Republican and total votes cast in each county using a `groupby().sum()`.
    - Find the `R_SHARE`.
    - Subset to just the `R_SHARE`, and add a column called Year that is the year for this election.
    - Finally use [`pd.concat()`](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/generated/pandas.concat.html) to concatenate the DataFrames for each election and write the result to `republican_shares.csv`


2. Create a plot with four time series of Republican vote shares in the following counties: Accomack, Amelia County, Amherst, Alleghany. Make sure your plot has meaningful axis labels and a title. (4 points)

    Hint: Use [set_index()](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/generated/pandas.DataFrame.set_index.html) to create a multi-index, select the `R_SHARE` column so you have a Series and then unstack.

3. Select at least 3 [variables](https://api.census.gov/data/2016/acs/acs5/profile/variables.html) from the 2016 5-year ACS whose relationship with 2016 Republican vote share you are interested in exploring. See the Variable Types table [here](https://www.census.gov/data/developers/data-sets/acs-5year/data-notes.html) for more information on variable types. Download them at the County level for Virginia using the Census API and rename the columns to something more meaningful before saving the data to a CSV called `acs.csv`. (4 points)

    Hint: Look at the [examples](https://api.census.gov/data/2016/acs/acs5/profile/examples.html)  (note the URL for 2016 is slightly different from 2014) and use the `in` parameter in the API to select Virginia and the `for` parameter to specify counties. Convert the result to a dataframe as in lecture and then use `to_csv()`.

4. Merge the ACS data from (B3) with the Republican vote share data from (B1) for the year 2016. Generate a pairplot using seaborn and save it as `pairplot.png`. Also run an OLS regression of the Republican vote share on the ACS variables and save the coefficients in a CSV called `coefficients.csv`. Summarize (Do not worry about being rigorous here) your findings in a sentence or two in `ANSWERS.txt`. (4 points)

    Hint: For the merge, remove ', Virginia' from the ACS and deal with the mismatched cases, e.g. by making everything upper case.
